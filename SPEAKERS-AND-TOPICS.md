# Techlahoma User Group Speakers & Topics

When a user group organizer is recruiting for a meetup presentation,
they can use this file to see speakers who have ready-made presentations,
so they can more quickly and easily find a presenter.

Please add your own topics and a speaker bio in the sections below.

To prevent you from getting speaking requests for old/stale presentations,
please only add topics that are either timeless (e.g., algorithms),
or topics for which you intend to keep up-to-date slide decks.

## Topics, Speaker

* Scary JavaScript (and other tech) that tracks you online, Luke Crouch
  * There are over 5,000 online trackers that use cookies, fingerprinting, and probablistic device matching to follow you across the web. Some methods are actively used for fraud, malware, and intrusive user tracking. Some are commonly used for legit purposes. We'll talk about how sites are able to follow users, tracking methods both fair and foul, and how users & developers can protect themselves from tracking.
* Crypto: 500 BC - Present, Luke Crouch
  * A 60-minute overview of The Code Book by Simon Singh, covering secrecy from ancient Greece to quantum cryptography. This is a cursory, high-level, mostly-non-mathematical survey of centuries of crypto - good as an intro to crypto for developers and non-devs alike.
* Top 5 Web Security Errors & Warnings we see from Firefox, and how to fix them, Luke Crouch
  * The most common security errors & warnings that developers see in the Firefox console are not that hard to fix. This talk covers what they are, why they are dangerous, and how to fix them.
* Work on Stuff that Matters, Luke Crouch
  * My story with Code for Tulsa began with these words from Tim O'Reilly at OSCON 2008. This talk summarizes the Code for Tulsa story from its inception in 2012 thru 2017 - the problems we've tackled, the events we've organized, and the apps we've built. Our hope is that our story will inspire coders and non-coders alike to get involved with - or start - a local civic technology group.
* Does your code work in Tor?, Luke Crouch
  * Tor is an open network and web browser designed to protect privacy. Millions of people connect with Tor every day. Is your code ready for them? This talk gives an overview of what Tor is, how it works, and how you can make sure your web code works well for its privacy-conscious user-base.
* An Introduction to Microcontrollers, Jonathan Bartlett
  * An introduction to the world of microcontrollers, what they do, and why we should care, focusing on the world of Arduino.  This is for groups who are generally unfamiliar with the embedded world and want to know more.  Flexible time, and can do versions of this talk that include more or less technical information about programming microcontrollers and/or the basics of electronics.
* Building Scalable Web Applications Using the Cloud, Jonathan Bartlett
  * A talk on the basics of making web architectures for scalability, including load balancers, caching, database replication, and programming in these environments.  Focused on developers who can build web applications but have kept to single-machine implementations.  Uses PHP, PostgreSQL, Linode, and AWS for its examples.  Based on a book by the same name.
* Getting the Most Out of PostgreSQL, Jonathan Bartlett
  * Many people only know a fraction of what the databases they use on a daily basis can do.  This topic covers a variety of lesser-known topics in PostgreSQL including replication, full-text searching, fuzzy searching, tuning, strange indexes, and strange column types.
* Computer Science and its Interrelationship with Philosophy and Theology, Jonathan Bartlett
  * Most people don't realize that the concept of computing was built to solve philosophical questions rather than business issues.  This talk follows the work of GÃ¶del, Turing, Chaitin, and others who have continued the conversation regarding the philosophical and theological insights that computer science has to offer.
* Intro to Continuous Delivery, Ryan Hoegg
  * Continuous delivery is a central theme in the DevOps movement, and certainly a central component of the culture. It is the set of engineering techniques, practices, processes, and tools for releasing changes to software services frequently and reliably.
* Microservices and Me, Ryan Hoegg
  * What are microservices, and why would we want to design things this way?
* Designing RESTful web services, Ryan Hoegg
  * REST is the architectural style that makes the web what it is. We now use it to make our own software as resilient as the internet itself. This talk explains why REST is good for your software, and how to design RESTful services.
* Messaging with AMQP, Ryan Hoegg
  * AMQP is a message queueing protocol that your applications can use to communicate.  I cover the different messaging patterns available through AMQP, when you might use them, and explore some extensions available when using RabbitMQ
* Reliable Software, Ryan Hoegg
  * Reliability is one aspect of software that everyone wants, some promise, and few achieve. We can confidently keep our reliability promises if we methodically plan for reliability in our software design. This talk explores the real meaning of reliability, andd methods to achieve it, through a story about a somewhat fictional project.
* Test Driven Infrastructure, Ryan Hoegg
  * Our servers, networks, and complete production environments can be delivered using many of the same techniques we've been successful with in software development.  This talk is a technical demonstration using Test Kitchen (http://kitchen-ci.org/) to build a production environment using automated tests.
* Responsibility, Concerns, and Cohesion, Suamere
  * There is a correlation between Separation of Concerns, and Coehesion.  There is a difference between Separation of Concerns and Single Responsibility Principle.  This talk details what each one is, and actual application of these principles in code.
* Exceptions: Playing Catch / To Throw or Not To Throw, Suamere
  * What if I told you that, in some codebases, I search CTRL+F for the word "catch" and, if any results come up, I fail code reviews.  There are strict times when you should ever use try/catch blocks.  This talk explains when you should Throw, Throw ex, or even catch in the first place.
* Anemia: How Anemic is too Anemic?, Suamere
  * The great Martin Fowler once wrote an article outlining why Anemic Domain Models are bad.  But what he was talking about was different than the Anemia we have today.  This talk outlines what Anemia means today, and why it is absolutely necessary in Service Oriented Architecture.
* Advanced Regex in C# Flavor, Suamere
  * This is a fun talk, if that's what you're into, about Regular Expressions in C#;  When to use them, How to use them, and some things C# Regex can do that no other Regex flavor can do.
* XSS Attacks - Stop 'em In Their Tracks!, Joshua Walcher 
  * What XSS attacks are and how to test your website and protect it from XSS Attacks. 
* Meteor - The Holy Grail of Full Stack Development, Sabrina Leggett (formerly Gelbart)
  * Write real time apps the awesome way with one language on the front and backend. Enjoy being up and running with almost zero configuration, with packages that just work on both the server and the client. Too good to be true? I think not.
* Slimming Down your Backend - Endpoint patterns for a sexy REST API, Sabrina Leggett
  * In this talk I'll go over how to easily create beautiful, useable, functional, secure endpoints. As a Laravel developer, until I saw FireBase, I'd only seen REST endpoints created by adding tons of boilerplate code, and on top of that developers had to create their own conventions for each one. Then I saw FireBase, and there it was -- endpoints created practically on the fly. So, as backend MVC developers, what can we learn from FireBase and other frameworks and how can we add onto it to make it work within our current requirements and workflow?
* Lessons from Wordpress - The Good The Bad & the Ugly, Sabrina Leggett
  * A talk for for people who like Wordpress or people who don't. What Wordpress really is, why some people hate it, what you can learn from it, and why it's not going away any time soon.
* Javascript Apps are Overrated,  Sabrina Leggett
  * Should you convert your whole front-end to be in React? Maybe, but listen to this talk first. I'll go over the advantages of keeping your app rendered on the server side, and solutions to common problems other than having to migrate.
